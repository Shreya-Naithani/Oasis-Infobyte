              Born in 1971, Elon Musk displayed an early talent in computers and video games and at the age of 12 created a video game code that earned him fame, as well as a fortune. He acquired a Canadian passport to avoid supporting apartheid in Africa at the time and also due to greater economic opportunities in the United States.

            Musk has created several successful firms since he left Stanford University in 1997. That year, he created the first company - Zip2. The firm,  which provided maps and business directories to online newspapers, was bought by Compaq in 1999. Then he created X.com which eventually merged with PayPal, which went public in 2001, and in 2002 eBay bought the firm for $1.5 bn. Musk in 2002, formed SpaceX and since then the aerospace firm has covered several milestones over the years. SpaceX became the first company to successfully relaunch and land at the first stage of an orbital rocket in late 2017. In 2020, SpaceX made history on May 30, after it flew NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, to space aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft using a Falcon 9 rocket.
